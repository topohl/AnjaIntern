What the project does
The following code is created to process data from a mouse 
experiment that tracks the activity of mice under stress. 
In Batch Merge the data is read into a dataframe, in 
processData the data is being filtered and grouped and in 
sleepAnalysis several test are executed on the data . 
Thus the data can be plotted and the results and the plots are saved.

My task is to clean, generalise, shorten, tidy up the code :)))

Why the project is useful
We want to use the written code for other experiments that may not be 
specialized on the activity but need a lot of similar calculations.

Who maintains and contributes to the project
The code is written by Tobias Pohl
